      "Even WiFi drops. So can you — the weight, the pressure, the guilt. Just for a bit.",
      "You're not behind. You’re on your own weird, wonderful schedule. Time is fake anyway.",
      "Feelings are just emotional farts. Awkward, surprising, but very human. Let them out.",
      "You're not a mess. You’re a Picasso. Some people just don’t get modern art.",
      "Rest isn’t laziness. It’s maintenance. Even superheroes nap sometimes.",
      "Not every thought deserves a TED Talk. Especially the anxious ones.",
      "Crying counts as cardio. Bonus points if it’s in the shower with dramatic music.",
      "You're basically emotional Teflon. The bad stuff slides off eventually — with a few dramatic pauses.",
      "Some days you're the pigeon. Other days you're the statue. Either way, you're part of the story.",
      "If life’s a circus, you’re the fire-eater. Bold, chaotic, and kind of mesmerizing.",
      "You're more stable than your phone battery after 2 years. That’s saying something.",
      "Your chaos has a rhythm. It’s not off-beat, it’s jazz.",
      "Breathe. Even fish do it. And they don’t pay taxes.",
      "You're not lost. You’re taking the scenic route through your own character arc.",
      "You’ve survived 100% of your worst days — statistically, you’re crushing it.",
      "Tears = emotional detox. Let it out. It’s your body’s natural reboot system.",
      "You’re someone’s favorite notification. Probably your dog. But still.",
      "Existential dread? Classic main character energy. Just add lighting and music.",
      "You're not a failure. You’re in your plot development montage. Cue the uplifting music.",
      "Your spiral is oddly artistic. We love a messy-but-stylish breakdown.",
      "You’re built for rerouting. Detours don’t mean dead ends.",
      "You're like soup. Sometimes salty, often comforting, always needed.",
      "Your mind’s dramatic, but your heart knows what’s real. Trust it more.",
      "Even rocks feel pressure. That’s how diamonds happen — and meltdowns. Both valid.",
      "You’re glitching in a very charming way. Keep going.",
      "You're not weird. You're an advanced setting most people don’t understand.",
      "Progress is just stylish flailing with slightly better outfits each time.",
      "You’re a mess — but the kind that gets displayed in modern galleries.",
      "You woke up. That’s rebellion in this economy. 10 points to you.",
      "The void isn’t mad at you. It’s just echoing your vibes back.",
      "You're still cute when you’re anxious. That’s unfair but true.",
      "Mood swings? Think of it as emotional jazz. Improvised but still art.",
      "You’re muted, but you’re still in the room. We hear you.",
      "You’ve got endurance, not speed. Marathons over sprints, always.",
      "Rest like it’s a protest. Because it kind of is.",
      "Feelings are weird, confusing, and often not facts. You're not broken.",
      "You’re not paused forever — just buffering in HD.",
      "This low moment? It’s a limited edition. Rare. Collectible. Not permanent.",
      "Even at your worst, you radiate ‘trying your best’ energy. And that’s gold.",
      "Rock bottom has great WiFi and surprisingly good people. Welcome. We’ve got memes.",
      "You're not late. Time is a colonial construct. Breathe.",
      "Even dragons need naps. You’ll breathe fire again soon.",
      "That emotion? Probably expired. Toss it out like sour milk.",
      "You’re doing enough — even if you only made it to the couch today.",
      "Don’t trust your 2am brain. It’s dramatic and poorly hydrated.",
      "You’re not bland. You’re emotional paprika. Small dose, big kick.",
      "You’re allowed to be a little feral. That’s just human seasoning.",
      "If vibes were currency, you’d be filthy rich — and slightly unstable. Iconic.",
      "Each breath is a tiny act of defiance. Inhale rebellion.",
      "Even planets wobble in retrograde. You’re allowed to have off days too.",
      "You don’t owe anyone a happy face. Especially not today.",
      "Sadness is a season. Spring always comes, sometimes slowly, but it does.",
      "You’re made of 80% magic and 20% caffeine. That’s science.",
      "Crying in the shower with dramatic lighting is elite-level self-care.",
      "Being tired of being tired is valid. So is doing nothing.",
      "You’re already more than enough. Even when you feel like half.",
      "You’re still the plot twist someone didn’t see coming. Keep going.",
      "You’re made of comeback material, glitter, and soft rage. Use it wisely.",
      "That panic? It’s your brain rehearsing a scene that may never happen.",
      "You're not broken. You’re just spicy and misunderstood.",
      "Today’s win: putting pants on. Or not. Either way, you’re trying.",
      "Your low days still count. Growth rings form in every season.",
      "Embrace your weird. That’s your entire brand and we support it.",
      "Being soft isn’t weakness. It’s what makes you human. And huggable.",
      "You’re not ‘too much.’ You’re a whole mood. Let ‘em adjust.",
      "Even legends have bad days. That’s how origin stories begin.",
      "Let today be what it is. Survive it with snacks and sarcasm.",
      "This version of you matters. Even if it’s 80% sweatpants.",
      "You don’t need a glow-up. You need a snack and less pressure.",
      "Your vibe is still valid. Even if it’s a little glitchy.",
      "Be dramatic. Then drink water and regroup.",
      "Your struggle isn’t your whole story. It’s just one strange chapter.",
      "You’re loveable — even when your hair’s a mess and your thoughts worse.",
      "You’re rebooting. Patience. Updates take time.",
      "You’ve survived this far. There’s power in that — and caffeine.",
      "Self-doubt is loud. Doesn’t mean it’s right.",
      "Tears aren’t weakness. They’re just emotional sweat. Let it drip.",
      "You’re healing. Healing is ugly and weird. Still counts.",
      "You’re not alone. You're just temporarily unplugged. Reconnect when you're ready.",
      "Anxiety is just mental jazz — messy but full of feeling.",
      "You’re still here. That alone is wildly impressive.",
      "Weird day? You’re still a whole vibe.",
      "Let the nonsense pass through you like a weird breeze.",
      "You’re doing a great job… at existing. And that’s enough.",
      "You’re not broken — just mid-transformation. It’s cocoon vibes.",
      "Vulnerability is hot. It’s like confidence, but braver.",
      "You don’t have to earn your rest. You deserve it because you’re alive.",
      "Your thoughts are just guests. Don’t let the loud ones redecorate.",
      "You’ve outlived every bad haircut. You’ll outlive this feeling too.",
      "You don’t have to fix the whole vibe. Just adjust the volume.",
      "Your mess makes others feel seen. That’s kind of heroic.",
      "The fog always lifts. Just walk slow and don’t trip on your feelings.",
      "Feeling flat? You’re still part of the song. Probably a bridge.",
      "You make sad look poetic. And kind of fierce.",
      "You don’t have to be okay. Just be honest. That’s enough.",
      "You deserve soft things, slow days, and zero expectations sometimes.",
      "Crying is healing in dramatic, liquid form. Hydrate afterward.",
      "Life’s weird. You’re weirder. You win."
